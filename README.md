# Parking-Lot-Management
🚗 Parking Lot Management System (Java)

A console-based Parking Lot Management System built in Java to simulate real-world parking operations. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

#✨ Features

🚘 Vehicle Entry & Exit – Register vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot

🅿️ Slot Allocation – Assign nearest available slot automatically

💰 Fee Calculation – Calculate parking charges based on duration

📊 Parking Status – Display available and occupied slots in real-time

🔑 Scalable Design – Can be extended for multi-floor parking or advanced features
